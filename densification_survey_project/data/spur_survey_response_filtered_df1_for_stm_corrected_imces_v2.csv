There are areas in the City of Chicago that are mostly vacant lots that should be considered for ""densification"" before coming into established neighborhoods and doing so in them to the detriment of present residents. The City of Chicago would do far better to focus on decreasing the bad policies that have been imposed for decades. It is already obvious that the City of Chicago is losing population and will continue to do so. In mandating increased density in residential neighborhoods it will only drive people out of the city.

R_1rwxC6DDg8YIRGS,This area is a conservation area and should be kept as such the thought of 50% or 100% increase in residents is not something most in this area including me would agree with this is a unique area in London which is very green. A larger population would mean more schools and transport and less greenery in an area of London that's unique in being so green which is important to the environment less mature trees mean less air quality new immature trees can not replace what imortant qualities ie air and environment that mature trees give us this area is low rise and would not support large high rise properties people move here for everything I've said. The property prices would plummet if this area is increased by 50-100% and we'd get problems with security and safety of residence and their property this area is seen as desirable creative literate and consists of multinational people living together mostly extremely wealthy Russians Chinese Japanese German Spanish Italian Greek people with many different religions. We have some great private schools well known schools in the area I would not want to live here and see my area devalued both in quality of environment ie both environmental and quality of neighbourhood eroded by a 50-100% increase few could afford over a million pounds for an apartment which is the average price of flats here houses 2-6 million.

R_Q9DvzJwXedjjipz,"1. There are a lot of unused buildings sitting idle because they are being ""warehoused"", waiting for a buyer or a demolition. These are typically old tenement buildings. I believe these buildings should be rehabbed and refitted with new appliances and wiring and then rented out affordably. There is a distinct lack of affordable housing where I live and if I weren't rent stabilized I wouldn't be able to live within 200 miles of here. The neighborhood before Covid was already very dense because there are several hospital systems in the neighborhood so more density would not work as the streets are already too crowded with autos, taxis, etc. The sidewalks are pretty crowded, too. There is also the issue of sunlight. I have lost so much sun coming into my apartment by the buildings that have been constructed around me, many by the hospital system. Streets are dark in the middle of the day around here where they used to be sunny. There is no green space around here. The mayor seems to be adding  green spaces downtown, in Brooklyn but not here for some reason. I guess there's no space as the buildings took it all up and the highway takes up the space by the river here. I would say the quality of life  has gone downhill in the last 20+ years due to overbuilding and high prices not only for rents/apartments but in the stores around here as well. So many stores have closed here during the pandemic I have to wonder how any will make a comeback. The real estate prices and taxes are off the roof here and that's a major problem, too. If I went to Brooklyn or Queens I would be paying a lot less for the same item I buy here. I have done it. I did it more when I had a car but I had to give that up because the building raised their garage rent to non-owners to a ridiculous level and there was no street parking because you compete with the hospital employees and bike lanes/racks that have taken away spaces and my freedom in a way.
